    "Q1. What is the purpose of Python&#39;s OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Answer - In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming . The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer - \n",
    "\n",
    "    All of these objects are namespaces (packages of variables), and the inheritance search is simply a search of the tree from bottom to top looking for the lowest occurrence of an attribute name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer - \n",
    "\n",
    "    Instance refers to the copy of the object at a particular time whereas object refers to the memory address of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What makes the first argument in a class’s method function special?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer - \n",
    "\n",
    "    Self is the first argument to be passed in Constructor and Instance Method. Self must be provided as a First parameter to the Instance method and constructor. If you don't provide it, it will cause an error\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q5. What is the purpose of the __init__ method?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Answer - The __init__ function is called every time an object is created from a class. The __init__ method lets the class initialize the object's attributes and serves no other purpose. It is only used within classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What is the process for creating a class instance?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Answer - When you create an object, you are creating an instance of a class, therefore \"instantiating\" a class. The new operator requires a single, postfix argument: a call to a constructor. The name of the constructor provides the name of the class to instantiate. The constructor initializes the new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. What is the process for creating a class?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Answer - To Create a class, use the keyword class \n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. How would you define the superclasses of a class?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Answer - A superclass is the class from which many subclasses can be created. The subclasses inherit the characteristics of a superclass. The superclass is also known as the parent class or base class."
