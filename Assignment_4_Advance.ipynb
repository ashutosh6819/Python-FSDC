    "Q1. Which two operator overloading methods can you use in your classes to support iteration?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Answer - The __iter__ returns the iterator object and is implicitly called at the start of loops. The __next__ method returns the next value and is implicitly called at each loop increment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. In what contexts do the two operator overloading methods manage printing?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Answer - \n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. In a class, how do you intercept slice operations?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Answer - \"setslice\" and \"delslice\" are deprecated, if you want to do the interception you need to work with python slice objects passed to \"setitem\" and \"delitem\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. In a class, how do you capture in-place addition?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Answer - iadd() This function is used to assign the current value and add them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. When is it appropriate to use operator overloading?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Answer - Operator overloading is mostly useful when you're making a new class that falls into an existing \"Abstract Base Class\" (ABC) "
