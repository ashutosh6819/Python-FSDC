    "6. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.values()?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Answer -  There is no difference. The in operator checks whether a value exists as a key in the dictionary. 'cat' in spam checks whether there is a 'cat' key in the dictionary, while 'cat' in spam. values() checks whether there is a value 'cat' for one of the keys in spam .\n",
